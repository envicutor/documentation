Why did we create Envicutor?
============================

Having studied multiple open source code execution systems for the past two years, we started to notice the strengths and weaknesses of many of them. We aim to combine the strengths we have observed and avoid the weaknesses while introducing new methods of solving common problems through a new code execution system.

Why a code execution system?
============================

Code executions systems power other systems that make use of remote code execution; such as: online IDEs, online assignment auto-graders, competitive programming systems and online interactive programming tutorials. We will refer to these systems as the client systems. By providing an improved code execution system, we can improve the user experience for the developers, the administrators, and the users of the client systems.

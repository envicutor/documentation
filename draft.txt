- What do I want the audience to know?
  - What a code execution system is
  - Problems with current code execution systems
  - How we built a code execution system that attempts to solve these problems
    - Isolation
    - Execution limits and metrics
    - Package installation and dependency management
    - Concurrency
  - Testing
  - Challenges
    - Security vulnerabilities can slip in easily
    - No definitive answer to most stuff

TODO: try removing clearpages

- Brainstorm ideas for the project and pick the best idea
- Analyze similar open source systems (skim the source code and check their github issues)
- Come up with an abstract idea of the project and the problems it aims to solve
- Re-analyze the open source systems to verify that the problems aren't already solved
- Brainstorm the overview of the project
- Write an initial developers' guide for collaborating on the project
- Set up continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) for the documentation of the project
- Write an initial use-case diagram, component diagram and activity flow
- Write an initial sequence diagram and an api documentation
- Come up with different technologies that can be used
- Experiment with the different technologies to validate feasibility and to choose the most appropriate technologies
- Update the documentation based on the new findings
- Write a throwaway prototype for the most crucial parts of the system to check feasibility
- Update the documentation based on findings from the prototype
- Write the initial pseudocode and class diagram
- Work on runtimes management
- Write runtimes management API tests
- Work on code execution
- Write code execution API tests
- Update the documentation and architecture based on findings from working on the system
- Work on simulation testing (simulating real contest submissions on Envicutor)
- Refine the system with more features and optimizations, refine the API tests
- Work on other demos of the system
- Re-structure the documentation and write an API documentation for the system
- Open source the system
- Work on CI/CD for the system
